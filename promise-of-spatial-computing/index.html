    <h1>[Promise of Spatial Computing]</h1>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Define what I'm talking about in terms of Spatial Computing / Mixed Reality</li>
      <li>Onion's concept of Glowing Rectangles as metaphor for what computing is today.</li>
      <li>Mixed Reality / Spatial Computing provides a mechanism to get beyond that.</li>
      <li>But what that really means isn't that we'll have <em>better computers</em>. It's that we'll have <em>different computers</em>, that <em>do different things</em>.</li>
      <li>The whole point is to help people accomplish tasks that are intrinsically spatial.</li>
      <li>Allude to (don't explain technical challenges)</li>
      <li>Effect change, Learn <em>from</em> objects, Learn how to <em>manipulate objects</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Not To Do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One common use case / idea is basically a floating glowing rectangle</li>
      <li>[Mockup of glowing rectangles]</li>
      <li>This strikes me as silly. It makes no sense. Why would you not just use a computer? Consider all of the additional cost, complexity, and overhead.</li>
      <li>The problem here is that nothing here is intrinsically spatial, which is the whole point of MR / Spatial Computing</li>
      <li>Charts? Virtual Characters? Etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Effect Changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[Video of Lights]</li>
      <li>Norman's <em>DOET</em> devotes a chapter to designing light switches</li>
      <li>His point was that one of the fundamental challenges of design is establishing <em>mappings</em> between the abstract real and controls for physical devices.</li>
      <li>That's the primary promise of spatial computing. In an ideal world, the interface just disappears.</li>
      <li>Controlling an individual light isn't that big. But imagine controlling <em>any</em> object.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Learn how to manipulate objects and move in space</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[Video of Keurig]</li>
      <li>We can't always control objects directly through computers. We don't necessarily always <em>want</em> to control objects</li>
      <li>Sometimes, we just need to know how to manipulate, change, or navigate objects in space.</li>
      <li>Compare this to using manuals or maps. As above, the benefit is that the information is <em>there</em>: contextually and spatially relevant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Learn from objects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[Big Hurt Sculpture]</li>
      <li>Sometimes, we just want to <em>learn</em> from an object.</li>
      <li>We want to draw attention to details or parts, or tell a story about an object, as in a museum.</li>
      <li>But the key is <em>from an object</em>. This doesn't really work all that well when it's just a 3D display of a virtual object.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Spatial computing could (in theory) represent a new paradigm for computing</li>
      <li>But that's because it's different, not because it's better at what we aleady do.</li>
      <li>So we need to follow these principles for design.</li>
      <li>But there are real limitations to the technology. HMDs basically suck. Phones are literal glowing rectangles. So until those are solved, this is in part just academic.</li>
    </ul>
