    <h1>THE CHALLENGES OF SPATIAL COMPUTING</h1>
    <div class="bodySection">
      <ul>
        <li>Explanation of what I'm talking about</li>
        <li>Reference and link to other essay on the promise</li>
        <li>Field is rife with bullshit, overpromises, and sci-fi dreams</li>
        <li>But if it's so amazing, why hasn't it been successful?</li>
        <li>The reality is far from the dream for these technologies</li>
        <li>Only fools try to predict the future</li>
        <li>Let's try to predict the future</li>
        <li>Challenges fall into two major categories:
          <ul>
            <li>Difficulties in the Devices Themselves</li>
            <li>Difficulties Posed by the External World</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>


    <h2>DEVICES THEMSELVES</h2>
    <div class="bodySection">
      <h3>Mobile</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Might be appropriate sometimes, but use of hands and screen is not immersive</li>
          <li>May not be better than just a screen / watch / etc.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>FoV</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Most common complaint when people put on Hololens for the first time</li>
          <li>Not necessarily like a low-resolution monitor - it actually means that objects disappear as you move around</li>
          <li>Real objects don't behave that way. And it might have downstream effects---LIMITS THE STAGE</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>THE VERGENCE-ACCOMODATION CONFLICT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Much bigger problem, but a lot more nuanced</li>
          <li>Technically complicated, but the result is that there's a limited space around the user where you can put virtual objects</li>
          <li>Is an INTRINSIC PROPERTY of stereoscopic displays. CANNOT be resolved incrementally, would require ENTIRELY NEW KIND of technology to resovle</li>
          <li>Further Limits the Stage</li>
          <li>IMPORTANTLY: Removes the possibility of hands-reach objects</li>
          <li>Doesn't mean it's IMPOSSIBLE to place things there, just INADVISABLE and especially bad for long-term comfort</li>
          <li>Does mean that it's IMPOSSIBLE TO DUAL FOCUS</li>
          <li>No surgery. No maintenance. No nothing.</li>
        </ul>


      <h3>SIZE, WEIGHT, BATTERY</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Uncomfortable</li>
          <li>No Moore's Law</li>
          <li>Certain fundamental physical limits</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>IMAGE QUALITY</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Not always a dealbreaker, but has impacts</li>
          <li>Why use shitty virtual monitor when a real one exists?</li>
          <li>Additive light kinda sucks, no shadows, no blacks, not realistic</li>
        </ul>


    </div>

    <h2>LOGISTICS / ENVIRONMENT / USE CASES</h2>
    <div class="bodySection">
      <h3>ENVIRONMENT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Algorithms for placing and tracking objects in space are impressive</li>
          <li>But they're real, which means they have real constraints</li>
          <li>Some applications require more precision than possible</li>
          <li>Some objects look identical, so CV algorithms could never handle it</li>
          <li>Making sense of unstructured environments is very fucking hard</li>
          <li>Controlling objects requires controllable objects, so it's not worthwhile</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>THE GLASSHOLE EFFECT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Entirely possible that these would really be that good, in a platonic sense</li>
          <li>But when push comes to shove people just don't want them, don't warn to them</li>
          <li>Strikes me as less likely (given enough benefits, people will do almost anything)</li>
          <li>Yet always possible</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>MAYBE IT JUST INS'T ALL THAT VALUABLE</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In another essay, I tried to lay out the major categories of usefulness for spatial computing</li>
          <li>But there, I didn't really consider the possibility that maybe these just aren't all that compelling</li>
          <li>Entirely possible for the technology to work, but for it to just not be that useful</li>
          <li>Maybe I'm overestimating how much help we need in navigating the world. Or maybe we don't need info from objects</li>
          <li>Maybe the singularity happens first</li>
        </ul>
      </div>


    <h2>CLOSING THOUGHTS</h2>
    <div class="bodySection">
      <ul>
        <li>Challenges are very real, and perhaps insurmountable</li>
        <li>Clearly limit what's possible today. Might limit what's possible forever</li>
        <li>But there's still some reason to be excited, if not exactly optimistic</li>
        <li>Certain things are possible, so worth exploring</li>
        <li>Always possible for black swans</li>
        <li>End with same message of taking things on a case-by-case basis</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
