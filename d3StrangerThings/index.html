      <a href="https://www.imaginaryforces.com/.com/" target="_new"><h2>ORIGINAL TITLE DESIGN BY IMAGINARY FORCES</h2>

      <div id="container"></div>


      <h2>WHAT IS THIS?</h2>
      <p>This is an attempt to re-create the main titles for the Netflix show <em>Stranger Things</em> entirely in the browser. The actual sequence was created by <a href="https://www.imaginaryforces.com" target="_new">Imaginary Forces</a>, and they of course deserve all credit for designing such a cool, iconic intro.</p>

      <p>The actual title sequence <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/" target="_new">was created </a> using sophisticated rendering software like After Effects and Cinema4D. As an experiment, I wanted to see the extent to which I could capture the look and feel of the design using decidedly less advanced software.</p>

      <p>In other words, I wanted to see the extent to which I could capture cinematic text effects entirely in code.</p>

      <p>Everything that you see in the example is SVG; there's no ray tracing, image textures, or post-processing going on. And while the differences are significant and noteworthy, I was surprised by just how much is possible using just vector graphics and a few filters.</p>

      <p>You can compare the two side-by-side here:</p>

      <h1>Aw Crap!</h1>
      <p>This is annoying, I know, but this experience doesn't really work well on mobile devices. You can try, but you're much better off trying this on a desktop or laptop.</p>
      <p>You can try by clicking the button below, but don't say I didn't warn ya.</p>
